# Harvard SCI6317 (Material Systems) Final Project - The Aura in the Age of Digital Materiality  :robot:
A repo containing the final project of Harvard's SCI6317 (Material Systems: Digital Design and Fabrication) where I developed a custom, modular, digitally controlled machine that produced a novel material process. SCI6317 was taught by Dr [Nathan King](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/nathan-king/) and [Zach Seibold](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/zach-seibold/).
