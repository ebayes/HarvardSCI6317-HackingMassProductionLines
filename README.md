# Harvard SCI6317 (Material Systems) Final Project - The Aura in the Age of Digital Materiality  :building_construction:
A repo containing the final project of Harvard's SCI6317 (Material Systems: Digital Design and Fabrication) where I developed a custom, modular, digitally controlled machine that produced a novel material process. SCI6317 was taught by Dr [Nathan King](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/nathan-king/) and [Zach Seibold](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/zach-seibold/).

* **SCI6317 Final Report** is the written element of the project, entitled: *"The Aura in the Age of Digital Materiality"*. It explores how digital fabrication tools can be customized in production lines to augment and amplify, rather than replace and devalue, artisanal practices by asking how we might ‘hack’ manufacturing processes to introduce controlled imperfections into production lines, such that no two products are ever the same.  *(Grade: Distinction)*  :man_artist:
* **Documentation** includes a custom Adobe Illustrator script (developed in python), machine code and images.  :snake:
